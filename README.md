# Visual novel stuff
Various collections of things for the Google Studio AI application that I "made" (vibe coded).

# Features
None — this repository is purely images, sfx, and JSONs. Not like it's an app or anything...

# What sprites are there?
Well, there are sprites ripped from visual novel games and then a bunch of AI slop that I made because I couldn't find any other good-looking VN sprites. I'm planning on adding some humans, though I'm not sure how that'll turn out, considering most visual novels have stupid anime girls that don't look remotely normal enough to be added. Maybe AI slop? Although I don't want to resort to using AI even if I already do.

# What about sound effects and JSONs?
Just a few of them — namely, the JSONs that I use for the application, which will obviously change when I interact with the application, and are only _made_ for the application. There are also the sound effects, but... those are self-explanatory.

# Am I a bum?
Yes, absolutely. This repository isn't made for anybody to see, but if you do see it and are reading this readme... maybe just click off cuz it's lowk embarrassing 🤔🤔
